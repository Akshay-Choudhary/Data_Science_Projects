# Data_Science_Projects


Repositoy includes different Data Science projects I have worked on using large datasets of upto 20 million records such as the Lending Club Dataset, Freddie Mac Loan Dataset, Edgar Dataset and EMS dataset.

Tasks I have performed on these datasets include:
1. Programatically download data.
2. Missing Data Analysis.
3. Data Cleaning.
4. Feature Engineering.
5. Uploading Cleaned Data to AWS S3 Storage.
6. Creating Prediction and Classification Models on Azure ML Studio using algorithms like Linear Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine.
7. Uploading Data to Azure Blob Storage.
8. Created Data Pipeline specifically Luigi to automate all the above task.

Conducted Exploratory analysis, Summary metrics by writing python scripts and visualised the results using PowerBI and Tableau.
